          <p>
            I am a driven, motivated, and dynamic Product Management
            professional with over 18 years of experience managing technology
            platforms. My experience ranges from writing requirements during the
            product development process to creating and presenting platform
            strategy to C-level executives. I have managed and mentored a team
            of 18 product managers, have been an individual contributor, have
            worked in both corporate organizations as well as start-up
            environments, and have managed large client programs and
            relationships. I possess both business acumen to understand
            industry, clients, and users as well as technical knowledge required
            to understand a platformâ€™s development process.
